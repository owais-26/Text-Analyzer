# Text-Analyzer


It's been 5 days since my React JS journey and by learning the basics of State, Hooks, Props and Components, I've Deployed a TEXT ANALYZER App.
We All know that sometimes we need to count our characters, words and sentences and even time to read any particular text so to make your counting easier it's one of the best tools.
Since many of us enjoy dark mode so I've also attached a Toggle button to Enable/Disable Dark Mode!!
This App is styled by BootStrap 5.2 and is Responsive means you can experience it on any wider screen to small mobile screen.
Check it and tell me more about how can i make it even better.
